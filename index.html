      <p id="tribute-info"> Argentine heart surgeon René Favaloro made his name in America where, in 1967, he performed the world's first documented heart bypass surgery. Favaloro was a rural doctor in his native Argentina, but became a pioneer of coronary surgery in the United States before returning to his homeland. During his career, he would claim to have performed some 18,000 heart bypass operations. In the end, the state of the Argentinean health system would prove too much for Favaloro. The doctor devoted his life to the provision of free, quality health services there. Increasing frustration and financial desperation led him to take his own life in 2000.

Favaloro was honored in Europe for his work just weeks before his death. He attended the opening of the Georges Pompidou European Hospital in Paris on June 26 and 27, 2000. While there, he confided his troubles to fellow Argentine heart surgeon Juan Carlos Chachques, who is director of the Paris hospital. "I have no doubt that this tragedy is a direct consequence of the financial situation in which Argentina's health system is embroiled, Chachques is quoted as saying in Lancet. "Dr. Favaloro faced the appalling prospect that everything he had worked to achieve … was on the point of disintegration." </p>
